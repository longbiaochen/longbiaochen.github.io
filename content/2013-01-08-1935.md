Recently I’m working on a web project and need to display a huge (thousands of items, say) list and a search box in which users can type to filter whatever they what to be displayed, in real time. I came up with this code snippet here to filter a list when the user press enter: 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/longbiaochen/6b41ccaca64254e2ca22.js"></script>

This piece of code is simple, easy to understand, beautiful (or so...), but fails to run efficiently when there are thousands of list items in stack.

After hundreds of google search and experiments, a working solution (or workaround, whatever) is proposed as follows.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/longbiaochen/fffb06db0f358466789e.js"></script>


As you can see, the trick is that we just changed the way items hide and show. 
I think the reason is that jQuery's [hide()](http://api.jquery.com/hide/) method is much slower than [show()](http://api.jquery.com/show/). Therefore, when a couple of consecutive calls to the method hide() are fired, the thread takes much longer to return.
